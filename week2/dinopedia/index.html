    <h2>Type of DinoÂ´s</h2>
    <ul>
      <h3>By Food</h3>
      <p>Omnivorous dinosaurs are those that can eat vegetables and meat without any problem, so they can feed on all kinds of food.
        Herbivorous dinosaurs are those that feed on plants. And yes, before you ask the question, we have already answered, they did have teeth.
        And you already know the carnivorous dinosaurs, they are all those that fed on meat.
        If you want to know more about dinosaurs according to their diet, enter the special sections we have prepared for each type.

        <h3>By Habitat</h3>
        <p>It is not really true that there are marine or flying dinosaurs at all.
           Although it is true that during the Mesozoic there were amazing creatures that soared through the air and swam in the dark depths of the sea, 
           the truth is that they were not dinosaurs, however </p>
