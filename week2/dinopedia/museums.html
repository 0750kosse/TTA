        is also home to some of the oldest fossils in the world. Displays include the Plesiosaur, the giant fish and the 540 million-year-old Charnia fossil.

      <p>The Isle of Wight is one of the richest dinosaur locations in Europe, with more than 20 species from the Cretaceous 
        period found on the island. The interactive Dinosaur Isle Museum has reconstructions of five local dinos; Neovenator, 
        Eotyrannus, Iguanadon, Hypsilophodon and the giant Sauropod. Displays use clever lighting, sounds, smells and animatronic 
        technology to create an exciting and at times scary experience for visitors. They also lead very popular fossil walks 
        throughout the year.</p>

      <p>Housed in her former home, Lyme Regis Museum celebrates the pioneering fossil hunter and palaeontologist Mary Anning, 
        who discovered the Ichthyosaur on the local beaches in 1811. The Geology Gallery contains a wealth of fossils and for 
        the real thing you can join one of their famous fossil walks along a historic stretch of Dorset coast.</p>
